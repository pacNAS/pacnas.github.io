          <p>
            pacNAS is a NAS distribution offering the whole stack of functionality for a simple NAS system out of the 
            box. The pacNAS community wants to offer a NAS distribution similar to other NAS distributions, but with some
            slight differences not offered from any other NAS distribution (at least right now).
          </p>
          <p>
            pacNAS will provide btrfs as the primary file system for the data storeage. You can expect to have an easy
            Installer at hand and also a webbased Administration tool (<a href="http://ajenti.org">Ajenti</a>).

            pacNAS is based on the <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a> distribution and therefor provides the
            famous <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">Pacman</a> package manager. Due to this, you will have
            access to a whole lot of packages. If you are interested in more packages, you can optionally install one of the
            <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers">AUR Helpers</a> (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/keenerd/packer/wiki">packer</a>)
            and access the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">ArchUserRepository</a>.

            pacNAS is an unofficial community project. It is still in development. There is currently no stable release 
            suitable for production usage yet. This project is not related to the official ArchLinux project other then 
            we are using their packages as a base to build this distribution.
