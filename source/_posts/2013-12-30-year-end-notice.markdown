This post is just a notice to inform you, that the year is going to end, but not
this project. Currently we are adding some functionalities to ajenti to provide a
working system also on ArchLinux. Since we are based on ArchLinux, this is also
of interest for our own project (lets put it in other words, we are doing these
extensions specifically for us and these are working on AL as well).
<!-- more -->

We still have plans for the project. It was quite silent during the last month,
but nonetheless we are still working behind the scenes on it. See especially the
commits we have done on the [ajenti](https://github.com/Eugeny/ajenti).

Furthermore we are trying to get approval of Simon (the owner of minimserver), to
be able to provide this nice UPNP-Server directly in our distro.

So, you see, some small but necessary features are in the works, and the next
most needed step is a first release of the installer-ISO. Please wait a couple of
days (aeh, weeks?) and this is going to happen.

Up until then, I do wish you all a happy new year ;-)
