In my last post, I have written about the [VectorLinux Buildbot](http://vlcore.vectorlinux.com/buildbot/).
We have now adopted this basic bot configuration to our needs and published it to
our [github repository](http://github.com/pacNAS/pnbuildbot).

The next step is now, to get this bot installed on our server, to make full use of it.
The bot is configured mainly via the pnconf.ini-File. Furthermore the manifest-File
contains a list of all packages, which are being build with the bot.

Oh, one more thing. We have now setup an IRC-Channel on the freenode-Network (where else).
You can try to get in contact with us on the #pacnas Channel. Hope to see you there.
