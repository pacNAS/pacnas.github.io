Having slept a good night I re-tought a couple of my previously written lines.

The release concept sounds still really cool to me, question is, if we really
do have enough resources to keep a rolling-release going. Most probably we could
reuse most of the stuff, that AL is already doing there, but it still is a lot
of work to stay in sync. My thoughts right now go into the direction of leaving
the rolling release aside and concentrate on a fixed release. The first fixed release
will basically be a snapshot of the current ABS in AL.

What do you think about this one?
