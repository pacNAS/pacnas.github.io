  <p>First post after a couple of busy month. After setting up my cubox-i (of course using
<a href="http://petemanchester.github.io/MediaPlayer/">MediaPlayer</a>) and some more systems
at home, I am back on track and try to push pacnas further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is not a lot of community interest in this project right now, so
if you like to participate or contribute, just write an email to <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#116;&#114;&#x69;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x40;&#x70;&#x61;&#x63;&#110;&#x61;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x65;">&#116;&#114;&#x69;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x6d;&#64;&#x70;&#97;&#99;&#x6e;&#97;&#115;&#x2e;&#100;&#x65;</a>.</p>

<p>Currently I do have some ideas for the future of this project and I would like to
bring these to your attention in this post.</p>

<h1>Release Concept</h1>

<p>After looking at a lot of other distributions, I do like the concept of <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a>
&ndash; pretty obvious, since this distro is going to be based on this one &ndash; but also
I do like others as well. For the release concept, I think, that <a href="http://alpinelinux.org/">alpinelinux</a>
has a very interesting one. It is a rolling release distro, if you look at the so
called &ldquo;edge&rdquo;-version. But furthermore there are several &ldquo;stable&rdquo; releases. Those
are snapshotted roughly every 6 month. Alpine seems to use the currently available
kernel at that time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> is doing something similar, in that they do a
release every 6 month and every 2 years they do an LTS release. They do have the
manpower to path their own LTS-Kernel, which is out of reach for us.</p>

<p>So every 6 month seem to be too often for a NAS distribution. Furthermore it looks
like, there needs to be patches for all available releases and this seems to be
too much work right now as well. One of the major tasks involved are IMHO the patches
for the kernel, because not every used kernel is an LTS kernel. See where this is
heading? I guess, the solution to this one, would be to make a release every year
at the time an LTS-kernel appears.</p>

<p>Obviously this does resolve patches for the Kernel, but other applications do have
different release cycles. This means, that the Snapshot could come to a slightly
too late or too early time for some applications. But this seems to be a minor
issue, in that if really needed for security purposes, the version could be bumped
even during a stable release (as long as the configuration of this application does
not change).</p>

<p>So the release concept for pacnas will look like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a rolling release</li>
<li>have a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release once a year or every two years when a LTS kernel appears
(this could already be 3.16?)</li>
<li>support each stable release for at least until the next stable release appears and
slightly longer (6 month?)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>To have a rolling release as well as a stable release does mean some implications
on the package selection. In the first release we could try to use the standard
pacman and provide a mirrorlist, which contains the release in the path to the
packages. This could be a problem, if a user would like to upgrade from one release
to another or to the rolling release. Therefor we could provide different mirrorlist-files
which contain a line like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Server = http://host/pacnas/rolling/$repo/os/$arch</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Server = http://host/pacnas/stable-1/$repo/os/$arch</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Please note, that the names of the releases are not fixed yet ;&ndash;)</p>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p>Security is pretty high on most server distributions. Alpine does solve this by
using <a href="http://grsecurity.net/">grsecurity</a> patches as well as <a href="http://pax.grsecurity.net/">Pax</a>
and most probably through other tools and/or patches on applications.</p>

<p>I guess we will put this on the todo list since right now, there is not much experience
with stuff like this. But it will be put very high on the list.</p>

<h1>Package Selection</h1>

<p>The package selection is pretty important as well. Since there are not much contributions
right now, the package selection will be very stripped. I gather, that the most
important packages for a NAS system will be put into the distro.</p>

<h2>first release</h2>

<ul>
<li>linux (well, that is obvious, right)</li>
<li>btrfs</li>
<li>samba</li>
<li>nfs</li>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>netctl</li>
<li>mdadm</li>
<li>ftp</li>
<li>rsync</li>
</ul>


<h2>future releases</h2>

<ul>
<li>ajenti or genesis</li>
<li>nginx</li>
<li>owncloud</li>
<li>seafile</li>
<li>crashplan</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have specific packages, which you would like to see on this list, do not
hesitate and write an email to the above mentioned email.</p>

<h1>Automatisms</h1>

<p>Since this distro is currently really understuffed (people and timewise), we need
as much automatisms as possible.</p>

<p>We are going to use the <a href="http://build.pacnas.de">pacnas buildbot</a> to build the
packages. Most probably this needs to get extended to be able to build dependent
packages in the correct order and fully automatic.</p>

<p>Furthermore we need to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; packages from AL to our own repository. This should
be done automatically as well. The most important part is to be able to sync changes
in AL into our own Repo, if necessary. At least the watch of changes needs to get
automated.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>

<p>During the next couple of days, I will dig into the above mentioned automatisms
and will try to automate as much as possible.</p>

<p>Some Marketing is required as well, but before we are going to make some advertisement
we should have a first rough version ready.</p>

  <p>First post this year, and I can annouce some progress on my personal media player
setting. My media setup is (like described earlier) totally based on UPnP. The
media server is <a href="http://minimserver.com">minimserver</a>, which will run on the pacnas
server. The UPnP control point is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.bubbleupnp&amp;hl=de">BubbleUPnP</a>
for my Android Smartphone.</p>

<p>I have already bought an <a href="http://www.cocktailaudio.de/index.php/de/funktionen.html">X10</a>,
but unfortunately this did not work out really as an UPnP Renderer. It works nicely
but not gapless, which is a necessity for me, because I do own quite some MixCDs.
There is a lot of discussion going on in the Forums, and hopefully they will add
this functionality. Therefor I just bought myself an <a href="http://cubox-i.com/">Cubox</a>
and I hope that this will work out. To test it, I just setup my Raspberry Pi with
<a href="http://www.runeaudio.com/">runeaudio</a> and installed <a href="https://github.com/ademenev/gmrender-resurrect-openhome">gmrenderer-resurrect-openhome</a>
on it, to enjoy the (currently bad quality) sound of my digitalized CD collection.</p>

<p>To get this really up and running, I needed to follow the <a href="http://blog.scphillips.com/2013/07/playing-music-on-a-raspberry-pi-using-upnp-and-dlna-revisited/">Installation Guide</a> from Stephen. Nice one, based on Debian, but still very
helpful. So I guess, that we are going to provide a package for the
 <a href="http://www.bubblesoftapps.com/bubbleupnpserver/">BubbleUPnP Server</a> on the pacnas system as well ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Hope this helps you as well ;&ndash;)</p>

  <p>This post is just a notice to inform you, that the year is going to end, but not
this project. Currently we are adding some functionalities to ajenti to provide a
working system also on ArchLinux. Since we are based on ArchLinux, this is also
of interest for our own project (lets put it in other words, we are doing these
extensions specifically for us and these are working on AL as well).</p>

  <p>In my last post, I have written about the <a href="http://vlcore.vectorlinux.com/buildbot/">VectorLinux Buildbot</a>.
We have now adopted this basic bot configuration to our needs and published it to
our <a href="http://github.com/pacNAS/pnbuildbot">github repository</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is now, to get this bot installed on our server, to make full use of it.
The bot is configured mainly via the pnconf.ini-File. Furthermore the manifest-File
contains a list of all packages, which are being build with the bot.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing. We have now setup an IRC-Channel on the freenode-Network (where else).
You can try to get in contact with us on the #pacnas Channel. Hope to see you there.</p>

  <p>We discussed the usage of btrfs in our previous post. We discovered a nice
mkinitcpio-hook, which allows us to provide a rollback option based on snapshots.
We have forked an up-to-date version, and will most probably provide some
additional documentation and scripts. For the source of the package see <a href="https://github.com/pacNAS/mkinitcpio-btrfs">github &ndash; source</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/pacNAS/pkgbuilds/tree/master/core/mkinitcpio-btrfs">gihub &ndash; package</a>.</p>

<p>Our new installer will use the suggested structure of the btrfs subvolumes while creating
the disk structure of the new system.</p>

<p>We do have created a new version of the above mentioned sources. This new version is
slightly adopted to our needs. The original version (<a href="https://github.com/xtfxme/mkinitcpio-btrfs">xtfxme</a>)
contains both the logic/source as well as the PKGBUILD, which we split, to keep these
separate.</p>

  <p>A couple of month ago I did start to rip all my CDs into the nowadays quite
popular flac-format. Just as an information, you can take a look into <a href="http://www.discogs.com/collection?user=triplem74">my</a>
discogs collection. This collection contains all CDs in my collection, which are
already converted. Right now (current number of collection items is 521) I did
convert already half of the whole (and unfortunately still growing) collection.</p>

<p>During this phase of ripping and tagging and handling my collection, I was searching
for a nice Media Player, which is able to play my quite large music collection
and present this in a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; way. Some goodies on this would be a control of
what is played via my smartphone or some other nice way (e.g. web interface). I
stumbled across <a href="http://www.minimserver.com">minimserver</a> and I am still very much
interested in this project.</p>
